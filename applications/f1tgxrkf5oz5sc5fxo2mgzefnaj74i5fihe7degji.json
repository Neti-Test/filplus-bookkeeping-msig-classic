    "Brief history of your project and organization": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global mapping project that aims to create a free, editable map. It is contributed by volunteers, and users can collect and update geographic information through GPS, aerial imagery, and other sources. Here are some important information about OpenStreetMap:\nFeatures\nOpenness: OSM data is completely open and can be used, modified, and shared by anyone. This makes it a very flexible tool for a variety of applications.\nCommunity-driven: OSM relies on contributions from volunteers around the world. These contributors can be anyone, from professional geographers to ordinary users.\nRich data: OSM contains a variety of geographic information such as roads, buildings, rivers, mountains, public transportation routes, etc., covering urban and rural areas.\nMultiple uses: Developers can use OSM data to build map applications, perform geographic analysis, or use it for navigation and positioning services.\nMultiple formats: Data can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as XML, PBF files, etc., to facilitate different usage scenarios.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
